Jury - line aoes - DO NOT MOVE IF DARK, go in for light
Upheld - Stack in mid then lps if light (Tether goes into exact mid to hold boss still)
	Go out to max melee then in partners if dark
Divisive - Go east for lps if light, out then in with partner if dark

For Lightstream: From odd one out: go to pizza slice behind the one that's moving away from it
Or two slices behind it idk either probably works

FOR D/L
Long tethers = same colour, short = different
Tanks on left side of arena, healers on right, position accordingly!
Based on which side you go and what tether you have, stand on the square marker

You know how to do the balls

Jury dark: START ON WAYMARK
	If long, stand still and other long will join you
	If short, go north if with tank south if with healer

Jury light: START ON WAYMARK, then head out to max melee to join up for lps e/w

Divisive light: Same as normal just you have to play around tethers

Divisive dark: Everyone go out to nearby intercards, then go in (LONG NEEDS TO ROTATE OBVS)

REMEMBER NOT TO MOVE UNTIL THE RAIDWIDE CLEARS TETHERS

dark current is really easy, start e/w then spread out behind the one moving away on your side
Then COLLAPSE IN WHEN THE SPREADS GO TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DODGE
(clockspots after)

Lotl - THE ONLY MECH YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEYOND SO LISTEN UP

Start southwest
Go to safe ball then smoosh yourself into the nearby safe portals as well - LOOK AT LINES ON FLOOR

Stay with group to take your stack then run to tank (at mid) like in shadowed messengers earlier

Soak your tower on your clock spot with your partner (main tank)
Then when done IMMEDIATELY go out west to do the shadowed messenger divisive shuffle
THERE WILL BE A KNOCKBACK - IMMUNE YOURSELF WITH ARM'S LENGTH AS YOU GO INTO THE DARK
Stay out after kb if dismissal was light, go in with partner if it was dark


Rest is repeat mechs and enrage
